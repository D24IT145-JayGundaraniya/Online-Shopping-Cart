# Online Shopping Cart

## Objective
This project is a simple shopping cart system implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to add products, remove products, calculate the total cost, and display a summary of the cart.

## Features
- **Add Product**: Adds a new product to the cart.
- **Calculate Total**: Uses `reduce()` to calculate the total cost of all items in the cart.
- **Remove Product**: Uses an arrow function to remove a product by name.
- **Destructuring**: Extracts and logs product details (name and price).
- **Template Literals**: Displays the cart summary in a readable format.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6 features)
- Node.js (for running the script, optional)
